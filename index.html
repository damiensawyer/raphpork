    <h1>How to make Bob's Crispy Pork</h1>
    <h3>
      To make Bob's crispy pork, start by slicing a pork loin into thin, even strips. Season the strips with a mix of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika, then coat them in a light layer of flour, shaking off the excess. Heat a generous amount of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the pork strips, cooking them in batches to avoid overcrowding
      the pan. Fry each side for 2-3 minutes until golden brown and crispy. Transfer the cooked pork to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. For added crunch, you can toss the crispy pork with a sprinkle of sea salt and a squeeze of lime juice before serving. Enjoy this savory treat as a delicious appetizer or a hearty main course!
